        <h2>History of the Portuguese Language</h2>
        <p>Portuguese is a Romance language originating from the Iberian Peninsula. It is the official language of Portugal, Brazil, Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe, and East Timor. The language evolved from the Latin spoken by the Romanized inhabitants of the region after the Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in the third century BC. Over the centuries, Portuguese spread to various parts of the world through exploration and colonization, becoming a global language with diverse dialects and accents.</p>
